# Mini RAG System Project

This project is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built in Python using Hugging Face Transformers. 
It uses a retriever model to find relevant information and a generator model to extract answers.

The notebook includes:
- Task 1: Building a basic RAG system and running self-assessment.
- Task 2: Adding new questions to the system.
- Task 3: Expanding the knowledge base and testing new facts.
